How to create themes for pelican
################################

Pelican uses the great `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org>`_ templating engine to
generate it's HTML output. The jinja2 syntax is really simple. If you want to
create your own theme, feel free to take inspiration from the "simple" theme,
which is available `here
<https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican/tree/master/pelican/themes/simple/templates>`_

Structure
=========

To make your own theme, you must follow the following structure::

    ├── static
    │   ├── css
    │   └── images
    └── templates
        ├── archives.html    // to display archives
        ├── article.html     // processed for each article
        ├── author.html      // processed for each author
        ├── authors.html     // must list all the authors
        ├── categories.html  // must list all the categories
        ├── category.html    // processed for each category
        ├── index.html       // the index. List all the articles
        ├── page.html        // processed for each page
        ├── tag.html         // processed for each tag
        └── tags.html        // must list all the tags. Can be a tag cloud.

* `static` contains all the static content. It will be copied on the output
  `theme/static` folder then. I've put the css and image folders, but they are
  just examples. Put what you need here.

* `templates` contains all the templates that will be used to generate the content.
  I've just put the mandatory templates here, you can define your own if it helps
  you to organize yourself while doing the theme.
 
Templates and variables
=======================

It's using a simple syntax, that you can embbed into your html pages.
This document describes which templates should exist on a theme, and which
variables will be passed to each template, while generating it.

All templates will receive the variables defined in your settings file, if they
are in caps. You can access them directly.

All of those settings will be given to all templates.

Include skribit script
======================

In order to support skribit scripts in your themes, you must perform these
actions:

 * Copy `skribit_tab_script.html` and `skribit_widget_script.html` in your
   templates directory.
 * Add {% include 'skribit_tab_script.html' %} in your <head> part in order to
   support suggestions tab.
 * Add {% include 'skribit_widget_script.html' %} where you want in order to
   support sidebar widget.

You can take a look at notmyidea default theme for working example.
